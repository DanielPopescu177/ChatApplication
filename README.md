Java Chat Application with the purpose of testing a hardware encryption(AES) module developed by me and a software Python encryption script (also developed by myself).

Features:
-GUI
-Starting the server and running it on a thread
-Connecting multiple clients in tabs (each running on a different thread)
-Chose between 3 types of encryption:
---Hardware encryption
---Javax.Crypto encryption
---Python implementation of AES 128b encryption (Integration done via Windows process calling the Python interpreter)
